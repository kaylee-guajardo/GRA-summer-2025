## Introduction

The following document contains an outline to three major types of occupancy models:

1\) standard single-species (false negative errors only),

2\) standard single-species with false positive errors, and

3\) standard multi-species.

Note that for each of the models under the formal theoretical model subsection, I have broken up each model into discernible components; minimally, all models have a component for the latent true occupancy state and the manifest observed detection state, with the latter conditional on the former.

To avoid redundancy, random variables, indices, and parameters are defined once prior to the theoretical model write-up for each type of occupancy model.

Before diving into the model overviews, two methods used for parameter estimation are enumerated below.

#### Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

#### Bayesian Estimation

## Standard single-species occupancy model

#### Random variables and indices (in the context of NABat)

-   $i$ indexes a grid cell in the 2020 NABat sample in MT, $i = 1, ..., n_{2020}$ grid cells

-   $j$ indexes a sampling replicate (i.e. visit) to a grid cell *i*, $j = 1, ..., J_i$ visits

-   $Z_i$ denotes the true occupancy state for the focal species in grid cell $i$, which is 1 if occupied or 0 if unoccupied

-   $Y_{ij}$ denotes the observed detection status for the focal species in grid cell $i$ during visit $j$, which is 1 if detected or 0 if undetected

#### Parameters (in the context of NABat)

-   $\psi_i$ is the probability of focal species occurrence at grid cell $i$

-   $p_{ij}$ is the rate of detection of the focal species at grid cell $i$ during visit $j$

#### Formal theoretical model

###### Latent occupancy state compononent

$$
z_i \sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(\psi_i)
$$

$$
\mathrm{logit}(\psi_i) = \mathbf{X}_i^T \mathbf{\beta}
$$

where,

-   $\mathbf{X}_i^T$ is a transposed vector of covariates that affect the probability of focal species occurrence ($\psi_i$) at grid cell $i$

-   $\mathbf{\beta}$ is a vector of regression coefficients (including an intercept) for the latent occupancy component of the model

###### Manifest observed detection component

$$
y_{ij} \sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(p_{ij} z_i)
$$

$$
\mathrm{logit}(p_{ij}) = \mathbf{V}_{ij}^T \mathbf{\alpha}
$$

where,

-   $\mathbf{V}_{ij}^T$ is a transposed vector of covariates that affect the rate of detection of the focal species ($p_{ij}$) at grid cell $i$ for visit $j$

-   $\mathbf{\alpha}$ is a vector of regression coefficients (including an intercept) for the manifest observed detection component of the model

### Model likelihood

$$
L(\psi_i | \mathbf{z}_i) \displaystyle \prod_{i = 1}
$$

## Standard single-species false-positive occupancy model

## Standard multi-species occupancy model
